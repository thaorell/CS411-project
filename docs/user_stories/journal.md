As an authenticated user, I can click “Current Trip”, “Completed Trips” or “Future Trips” on the header, so I can modify my trips. 
If I click “Completed trip”, I will see a list of trips (e.g. “2018 Northeast Extravaganza”). Clicking on any of them will show a map of visited restaurants with my locations and visit dates. 
If I click “Current trip”, I will see a map with all restaurants I have visited. I can also view the locations and dates in which I planned for the visits and modify the dates as needed. I also has the option to click “Mark as Completed” to complete my food journal and the current trip will be moved to “Completed Trip”. 
If I click “Future trip”, I will be able to view the map of restaurants I wish to visit for a future trip. Here, I can enter the dates that I plan to visit.
