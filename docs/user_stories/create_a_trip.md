As an authenticated user, I can look up a restaurant by entering location(town name or zip code), and/or restaurant names and cuisine. 
The default home screen will display a search bar with a “Search” button in the middle of the page so I can create a new food journal. A list of restaurants, with reviews and ratings from Yelp and photos from Instagram or Google Image, will be displayed if “Search” is clicked. I will select restaurant(s) that I might want to visit or have visited and the date I visited/ plan to visit the restaurant.
