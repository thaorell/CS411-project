As an authenticated user, I could click on the cart symbol on the top right of the page, where I will have options to edit the restaurants I added in the cart, so I can create a new trip or add restaurants to currently existing trip(s). 
To create a new trip, I would click on “Create a New Trip” button and a form will pop up where I will enters the trip’s name and time.
To add to existing trips, I would click on “Add to Current” and select a trip. If there is no existing trip, “Create a New Trip” button will show up.
