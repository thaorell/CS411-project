As an authenticated user, I can look up a restaurant by entering location, like town name or zip code, and search terms, like restaurant name and cuisine. 
The default home screen will display a search bar with two items, terms and location, with a “Search” button at the end of the search bar. A list of restaurants, with ratings and address fetched from Yelp and photos from Google Custom Search, will be displayed if “Search” is clicked. At the end of each restaurant row, I can select the trip I want to add this restaurant to.
