As an authenticated user, I can access the "My Trip" page from clicking a header of the page. In that page, I can create a trip by clicking on "Create a trip" button. If I had exisiting trips, the restaurants name will be display as a list below the trip's name. I can also delete a restaurant from a trip or delete a whole trip. If I want to add a restaurant to the trip, I would visit the Search page.
