Logging In
As an unauthenticated user, I will see a screen asking to “Continue with Twitter”, “Sign up” or “Login”. 
If I clicks the “Continue with Twitter” button, a pop up form will ask them to enter my user name and password for Twitter. 
If user does not have a Twitter account, I can also click “Sign up” using my email. I will see a form and enter my first name, last name, email address, and password. If my email has already been registered, I will get an error message.
If I already have an account, I can click on the “Login” button, then I will see a form to enter my email and password.
After the login is successful, I will be directed to the home page of the application.
